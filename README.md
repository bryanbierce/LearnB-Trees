# Learn B-Trees
A test-driven approach to learning how to implement B-Trees in JavaScript

### Why should I use this?
If you want to learn how to make a B-Tree, of course!  This repo uses a test running html document, SpecRunner.html, to
double check your work and (hopefully) guide you through the process of creating your own bloom filter in javascript.  This learning style has been unabashedly stolen from [Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com/), where I am currently a student. The inspiration for this repo was the work of two amazing indivdiuals who came before me: [Adam Van Antwerp](https://github.com/TheAdamizer) and [Nick Balestra](https://github.com/nickbalestra). Thanks for leading by example guys! And thanks for being awesome Hack Reactor!  

B-Tree's are an amazing data structure that are highly optimized for fast retrieval and often lie at the core of databases. For more information on them check out [my blog post](http://bryanbierce.com/blog/11-29-Btree.html),
where I give an explanation on their structure and outline some instances where a developer may find them useful.
If you find that this not enough information to fully implement a B-Tree, feel free to drop me a line and request some
clarification and I'll do my best to update the post with the new details.
